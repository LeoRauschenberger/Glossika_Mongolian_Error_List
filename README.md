# Glossika Mongolian Language Error List
Errors found in Glossika's Mongolian course (https://ai.glossika.com)

This folder contains an openly accessible list compiling the errors in Glossika's Mongolian course. 
I feel obligated to take this step as Glossika will simply remove sentences that are being reported with NO feedback or fix visible to the user.

I know how frustrating and makes learning harder as the errors are frequent enough for me to be on constant alert while learning. 

List will be updated frequently.

A further issue I have noticed is that Glossika does not follow the standart for transliterating Molgolian to the letter (https://estandard.gov.mn/standard/reader/4635). Ð¥ is falsely transliterated as X which is not really a transliteration.

I now completed Level A1 Low so the entire list is avialable. If you found additional errors, reach out to me.
